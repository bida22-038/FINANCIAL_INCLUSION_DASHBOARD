1. Navigate to Your Project Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory of your project:

cd /path/to/your/project
Copy
2. Initialize Git (If Not Already Initialized)

If your project is not already a Git repository, initialize it:

git init
Copy
3. Add Files to Staging Area

Stage all files in your project for the commit:

git add
Copy
4. Commit the Changes

Create a commit with a descriptive message:

git commit -m "Initial commit"
Copy
5. Link to the Remote Repository

Add the URL of your existing GitHub repository as the remote origin:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Copy
6. Push Code to GitHub

Push your code to the main branch of the remote repository:

git branch -M main # Rename branch to 'main' if necessary
git push -u origin main
Copy
Important Notes

Replace <username> and <repository> with your GitHub username and repository name.

If the remote repository already contains files (e.g., a README), you may encounter conflicts. To resolve this, pull changes first:

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
Copy
By following these steps, your local code will be successfully pushed to the existing GitHub repository.
