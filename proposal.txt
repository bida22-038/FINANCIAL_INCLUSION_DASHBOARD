I propose to investigate the impact of mobile money adoption on income stability and 
small-business growth among informal traders in Botswana’s urban and peri-urban markets. 
Botswana’s informal trading sector—employing roughly 190,000 people in 2015/16 and dominated 
by very low monthly incomes—relies heavily on cash transactions, leaving traders vulnerable 
to shocks and excluded from traditional finance. While mobile wallets such as Orange Money, 
MyZaka and Smega have rapidly expanded and promise greater financial inclusion, the concrete
effects of these services on traders’ earnings volatility and business expansion remain 
under-researched. I will use a mixed-methods approach combining surveys to quantify changes 
in income variability and firm performance with in-depth interviews to capture adoption 
barriers and lived experiences. The study aims to provide evidence to inform policy and 
fintech strategies that strengthen income resilience and support the growth of informal 
small businesses.
